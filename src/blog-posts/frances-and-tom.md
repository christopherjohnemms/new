Beautiful, natural and genuine: just a few simple words to describe a day that could not possibly be justified by words. Frances and Tom's authentically elegant wedding at [Upthorpe Wood](https://www.upthorpewood.co.uk/) was the kind that strips away all the pageantry and reminds you of what a wedding is beneath it all - an incredibly special ceremony where two people, two families, come together to become one. Everything about this wedding was so modest, joyous and bursting with love, and we feel especially humbled to have been the ones to capture this day.
